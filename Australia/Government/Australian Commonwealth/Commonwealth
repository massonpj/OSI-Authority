<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Open Source Initiative</strong> (OSI), an organisation established to promote open source software, has developed an <strong>Open Source Definition</strong> (OSD) as follows... (Pg. 4)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Keep this list up to date in the agency’s source repository, and use the <strong>Open Source Initiative</strong> and Free Software Foundation websites to verify compatibility between licences. (Pg. 38)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The Free Software Foundation is emphatic that it does, while the <strong>Open Source Initiative</strong> thinks the situation is unclear. (Pg. 40)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, in the absence of a clear judicial ruling to the contrary, it would be unwise to adopt a practice in opposition to advice given from the Free Software Foundation or the <strong>Open Source Initiative</strong>. (Pg. 40)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>A list of open source licences managed by the <strong>Open Source Initiative</strong> is available at http://www.opensource.org/licenses. (Pg. 47)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At present, the primary arbiter of what constitutes open source software is the <strong>Open Source Initiative</strong>. (Pg. 9)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>While many in the open source industry would prefer to restrict further fragmentation in licensing, there is no mechanism to prevent new licences being added to the list maintained by the <strong>Open Source Initiative</strong>. (Pg. 40)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>All licences certified by the <strong>Open Source Initiative </strong>(OSI) as compliant with the <strong>Open Source Definition</strong> share important characteristics. (Pg. 41)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Standard Creative Commons licences are not designed for use with software. However, there are a number of alternative standard, open content licences that are specifically designed for use with software. Creative Commons recommends considering licences made available by the Free Software Foundation (http://www.fsf.org/) or the <strong>Open Source Initiative </strong>(http://www.opensource.org/). Agencies are encouraged to seek expert advice if they are considering publically releasing software and/or underlying code. (Pg. 90 )</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Creative Commons licences do not contain terms relating to the use of source or object codes. There are other open content licences specifically designed for software, these would be considered if the Commonwealth owns copyright in the software and the author agency determines that providing open access to the underlying code is appropriate. See for example the licences available through the Free Software Foundation http://www.fsf.org/ and the <strong>Open Source Initiative</strong> http://www.opensource.org/ (Pg. 185 )</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Open source software is computer software which is defined by several specific attributes that relate to its licensing and legal framework. For guidance on what constitutes open source software, refer to the <strong>Open Source Initiative</strong>. The Initiative sets out various rights and obligations for developers, distributors and users of open source software. These rules define the basic licence conditions under which software must be released to be considered 'open source'. (Pg. 13)</p>
